  caveats <<~EOS
    Ludolph runs pi agents, so it needs pi: https://pi.dev

    Ludolph isn't notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks it the first time you open it.
    To allow it, open Ludolph once, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
    and click "Open Anyway" next to the message about Ludolph.
